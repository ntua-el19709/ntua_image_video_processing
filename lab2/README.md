# Study of NN models for image classification

In this exercise we compare the Neural Network models proposed in these papers:

- [Handwritten Digit Recognition with a Back-Propagation Network](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1989/file/53c3bce66e43be4f209556518c2fcb54-Paper.pdf)
- [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf)
- [Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf)

Also we provide an implementation for these models as well as one more (designed by us), and use them on subset of the cifar100 dataset. After we train the models we create some plots that graph the training and the validation accuracies, as well as compare the models.
