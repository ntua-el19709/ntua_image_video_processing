# Study of the Laplacian Pyramid

In this exercise we study the article [The Laplacian Pyramid as a Compact Image Code](http://persci.mit.edu/pub_pdfs/pyramid83.pdf). We answer some questions about the way the pyramid works as well as provide an implementation of the algorithm.

## Questions

The following questions are answered in the notebook (in greek):

- How does the value of a affect the Gaussian pyramid?
- What do we define as entropy? Calculate the maximum entropy that a grayscale image can have.
- How does the choice of bin size affect the result of quantization?
- Explain how quantization is affected by the number of layers in the pyramid.

## Files

The exercise is implemented in the Jupyter Notebook `IVP_lab1.ipynb`, and the image `lena.png` can be also found in this directory.
